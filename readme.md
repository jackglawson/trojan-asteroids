# Trojan Asteroids

A project for University of Cambridge part II Physics, programming module. 

### Abstract

Asteroids at Jupiter’s L4 Lagrange point were simulated in Python and their oscillations about L4 observed. The initial conditions in displacement and velocity space were perturbed and the effect on the stability and range of wander from L4 was measured. The range of wander was found to be proportional to $M^−0.497$, where M is the planetary mass, and no stability was observed for $M/M_o > 0.0415$, in good agreement with the
analytic critical value of 0.04006. 

Run a single simulation from main.py
